# **Prerequisites for Your Real-Time IoT Monitoring System**

Let me break down everything you need before building this project - think of it like gathering all the ingredients before baking a cake!

## **1. Kitchen Tools (Software & Accounts)**

### **A. Microsoft Fabric Access**
- **What it is:** Your main workspace (like a digital kitchen)
- **How to get it:**
  1. Go to [Microsoft Fabric website](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com)
  2. Click "Try Free" (no credit card needed)
  3. Use your work/school email or sign up with a personal Microsoft account

*Pro Tip: The free trial gives you $200 credit to play with!*

### **B. Azure Event Hubs**
- **What it is:** A message funnel for your sensor data
- **How to set up:**
  1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
  2. Search for "Event Hubs"
  3. Click "Create" and choose:
     - Basic tier ($0.05/hour)
     - Name it "iot-factory-alerts"

*Alternative: If Azure seems scary, Microsoft Fabric has built-in sample data you can use instead!*

## **2. Ingredients (Data & Code)**

### **A. Sample Data File**
- **What it is:** Practice sensor readings
- **How to get it:**
  1. Download this simple CSV: [factory_sensors.csv](#)
  2. It looks like this:

| timestamp | machine | temp | location |
|-----------|---------|------|----------|
| 2024-06-01 09:00 | A | 72 | Toy Room | 
| 2024-06-01 09:01 | B | 150 | Paint Room |

### **B. Optional: Python Script**
- **What it is:** Fake sensor data generator
- **You'll need:**
  - Python installed ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
  - Install one package (type in command prompt):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas azure-eventhub
    ```

## **3. Cooking Skills (Basic Knowledge)**

### **A. Absolute Minimum**
- How to click buttons in a web browser
- Ability to copy/paste (seriously, that's most of it!)

### **B. Helpful But Not Required**
- Basic understanding of:
  - What IoT devices are (those little smart sensors)
  - What "real-time data" means (instant updates)
  - How dashboards work (like car speedometers)

## **4. Time Investment**
- First-time setup: 15-30 minutes
- Building the project: 30-60 minutes
- Drinking coffee while watching it work: Priceless

## **Troubleshooting Your Shopping List**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't sign up for Fabric | Try a different email address |
| Azure too complicated | Use Fabric's built-in sample data instead |
| Python script fails | Just upload the CSV manually |
| Feeling overwhelmed | Start with just Power BI + sample data |
