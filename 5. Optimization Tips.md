This is where we make the big TV screen that shows all our factory machines - with colors and alarms when something's wrong! I'll guide you through every single click.

## **A. What We're Building**
Imagine a car dashboard, but for your factory:
- ‚úÖ Speedometer showing current temperature
- üó∫Ô∏è Map of where machines are located
- üî¥ Red flashing alerts for hot machines
- üìä History chart showing past temperatures

## **B. Step-by-Step Setup**

### **1. Open Power BI Desktop**
1. On your computer, find the **Power BI Desktop** app
   - If you don't have it: [Download here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)

*Pro Tip: It looks like Excel with more colorful buttons*

### **2. Connect to Your Emergency Data**

2. Choose **"Azure"** ‚Üí **"Real-Time Analytics"**
3. Select your **"EmergencyAlerts" Eventhouse**
4. Click **"Connect"**

*What's happening: You're plugging into the fast notepad we made earlier*

### **3. Make the Temperature Speedometer**
1. On the right side, find the **"Visualizations"** panel
2. Click the **Gauge icon** (looks like a car speedometer)
3. In your data fields (right side):
   - Drag **"temperature"** to the **"Value"** box
   - Drag **"machine"** to the **"Legend"** box

4. Make it pretty:
   - Right-click the gauge ‚Üí **"Format visual"**
   - Set:
     - Min value: 0
     - Max value: 200
     - Warning at: 100 (turns yellow)
     - Danger at: 150 (turns red)

*Now it looks like a thermometer for each machine!*

### **4. Add the Factory Map**
1. Click a blank spot on your dashboard
2. In Visualizations, click **"Map"** icon
3. Drag these fields:
   - **"location"** to "Location"
   - **"machine"** to "Legend"
   - **"temperature"** to "Size"

4. Make bubbles colorful:
   - Right-click map ‚Üí "Format visual"
   - Set:
     - <100¬∞ = Green
     - 100-150¬∞ = Yellow
     >150¬∞ = Red

*Now you see where hot machines are in your factory!*

### **5. Add the Temperature History Chart**
1. Click a blank spot
2. Choose **"Line chart"** visualization
3. Drag:
   - **"timestamp"** to "X-axis"
   - **"temperature"** to "Y-axis"

4. Make it useful:
   - Click the chart ‚Üí "Format" ‚Üí "Title"
   - Type: "Temperature History (Last 2 Hours)"

2. Choose **"Data source settings"**
3. Set refresh to **every 30 seconds**
4. Click **"OK"**

## **D. Test Your Dashboard**
1. Edit your sample data CSV:
   - Change Machine B temperature to `155`
   - Save the file
2. Watch your Power BI:
   - Within 30 seconds:
     - The gauge should spike red
     - Map shows red bubble at Paint Room
     - Chart shows sudden temperature jump

## **Troubleshooting**

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No data shows up | Check Eventhouse connection |
| Map shows wrong location | Make sure "location" field has real place names |
| Gauge stays at zero | Verify "temperature" is a number, not text |
| Everything looks weird | Click "View" ‚Üí "Refresh visuals" |

## **Pro Tip: Make It Extra Fancy**
1. Add a **big number visual** showing "Machines Overheating Now"
2. Include **machine photos** (use "Image" visual)
3. Set up **email alerts** from Power BI service

---

## **What You've Built Now**
- üö® Live overheating alerts
- üìç Visual factory map
- üìà Temperature history tracking
- üîÑ Auto-updating every 30 seconds

Your factory manager can now watch this screen like a security guard watching cameras! Next step: Show it off on a big TV in the office.
